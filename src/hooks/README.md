# src/hooks

Custom React hooks used in the app.

Files:

- `use-mobile.tsx` - helper hook for detecting mobile viewport or touch devices.
- `use-toast.ts` - convenience wrapper to show toasts via the project's toast implementation.

Edit these hooks to change cross-cutting behaviors; they are imported directly by components.
