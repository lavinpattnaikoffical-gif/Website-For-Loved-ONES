# public/photos

This folder stores images used by the photo gallery and other UI parts.

Guidelines

- Add new images here and reference them from `src/components/birthday/PhotoGallery.tsx`.
- Use consistent, descriptive filenames (e.g., `friend-jane.jpg`, `cake-2025.jpg`).
- Optimize images (resize/compress) for the web before adding.
