# public/music

Place background audio files used by the site here.

Conventions

- Expected filename for the site's background music: `websitebackgroundsong.mp3`.
- If you add a different name, update the path used in `src/components/birthday/BackgroundMusic.tsx`.
- Keep files reasonably small to avoid long load times.
